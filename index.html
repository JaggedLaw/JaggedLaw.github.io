	  	  	<p align= "left"> Welcome to my page! I have spent the past several years learning many trades, from programming to bookkeeping to barista to graphic arts. I have recently come full circle to dive completely into my original passion of development. Being a student at Turing School of Software & Design has opened doors to the world of coding that I have always desired (and I have the github to prove it!). Given my diverse background, I have a lot of life experience that has given me A LOT of ideas. Turning ideas and plans into an application that works is incredibly fufilling and exciting. I believe development makes lives easier and dreams come true. I cannot wait to make this my profession. Thanks for visiting!</p>
